      <h1> What are Higher Order Component in React?</h1>
      <p>
        A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for
        reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se.
        They are a pattern that emerges from Reactâ€™s compositional nature.
